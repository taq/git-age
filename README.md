# Git::Age

Would you like to know how many lines from the past still persists on your
repository? This gem can help with that.

It will create a CSV file with year, month and the line count from the specified
period.

Also, with some CLI graphic processor installed, it can create an image with a
graph showing the CSV data as a bar graph.

## Installation

```
$ gem install git-age
```

## Usage

Go to your repository and run:

```
Usage: git-age [options]
    -b, --branch=BRANCH              Git branch
    -o, --output=FILE                Output file
    -i, --image=FILE                 Image file
    -g, --graph=PROCESSOR            Graphic processor
    -t, --title=TITLE                Graphic title
    -x, --xtitle=TITLE               X axis title
    -y, --ytitle=TITLE               Y axis title
```

Example:

```
$ git-age -o /tmp/data.csv -t 'Test project' -x 'Dates here' -y 'Lines here' -i /tmp/data.png
```

Supported image processors:
